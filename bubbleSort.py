        lambda: {"question": "Describe the best-case time complexity scenario for Bubble Sort.", "answer": "The best case is when the array is already sorted; optimized Bubble Sort detects no swaps on the first pass and finishes in O(n) time."},
        lambda: {"question": "What is meant by Bubble Sort being a stable sorting algorithm?", "answer": "Bubble Sort maintains the relative order of equal elements, meaning duplicates remain in their original sequence after sorting."},
        lambda: {"question": "Explain why Bubble Sort is considered an in-place sorting algorithm.", "answer": "Because it requires only a constant amount of extra space and rearranges elements within the original array without needing additional arrays."},
        lambda: {"question": "How does Bubble Sort's performance change with nearly sorted data?", "answer": "Performance improves significantly because fewer swaps occur, and with the swap flag optimization, it can finish early."},

        lambda: {"question": "How does Bubble Sort ensure the largest element reaches its correct position after each pass?", "answer": "By repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if the left one is greater, the largest element 'bubbles' to the end."},

        lambda: {"question": "Describe how Bubble Sort handles duplicate elements.", "answer": "Duplicates are kept in their original relative order, maintaining stability."},
        lambda: {"question": "What is the significance of comparing adjacent elements instead of distant elements?", "answer": "Comparing adjacent elements allows gradual sorting by pushing larger elements towards the end step-by-step."},

        lambda: {"question": "Explain why Bubble Sort is classified as a comparison-based sorting algorithm.", "answer": "Because it sorts by comparing pairs of elements to decide if a swap is needed."},
        lambda: {"question": "What is the impact of Bubble Sort on nearly sorted versus randomly ordered arrays?", "answer": "Nearly sorted arrays benefit from fewer swaps and early termination; random arrays do not."},
        lambda: {"question": "How is the number of passes reduced after each iteration in Bubble Sort?", "answer": "Because the largest element settles at the end, subsequent passes ignore the sorted end portion."},

        lambda: {"question": "Explain the worst-case input for Bubble Sort and why it is so inefficient.", "answer": "A reverse-sorted array causes maximum swaps and comparisons, leading to O(n^2) operations."},
