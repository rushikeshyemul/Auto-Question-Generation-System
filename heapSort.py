It is important in Heap Sort because it allows efficient extraction of the maximum (or minimum) element to sort the array."

        "question": "Why does Heap Sort have O(n log n) time complexity?",

        "question": "What is the difference between a max-heap and a min-heap?",
        "answer": "A max-heap is a heap where each parent node is greater than or equal to its children, ensuring the largest element is at the root. A min-heap is the opposite, with each parent node less than or equal to its children, so the smallest element is at the root."
    },
